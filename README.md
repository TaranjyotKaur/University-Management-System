## ðŸ”’ Security Updates in `security-patches`

The following changes have been implemented to strengthen the project against common vulnerabilities:

1. **Password Security**
   - Plain-text passwords replaced with **hashed passwords** using a secure hashing algorithm.
   - Added password salting to improve resistance against brute-force and rainbow table attacks.

2. **SQL Injection Prevention**
   - All database queries now use **prepared statements** instead of string concatenation.
   - User inputs are properly parameterized to block SQL injection attempts.

3. **Input Validation**
   - Added strict validation and sanitization of user inputs.
   - Prevents malicious inputs such as script injection and invalid data.

4. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Removed exposure of sensitive database/system errors to the end user.
   - Added user-friendly error messages while logging technical details securely.

5. **Secure Session Management**
   - Implemented proper session handling.
   - Reduced risks of **session fixation** and **unauthorized access**.

6. **Project Structure Updates**
   - Updated file organization for better maintainability.
   - Added comments to highlight secure coding practices.
